2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A: A virtual private server is a service provided by companies such as Internet service providers that allow a user access to a server without having to invest in a physical server.

Advantages: 1) A user can install any software that runs on the VPS OS. 
2) Though it functions like a physical server,it is much more easily created and configured because it is software defined. 
3) It is cheaper than an equivalent physical server. 


3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
A: Root level access to a user allows the user to circumvent built in protection mechanisms, thus allowing software or malicious programs to completely destroy the systems or delete all data. Root level access also prevents the system from throwing out warnings.
