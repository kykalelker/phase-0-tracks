# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

1. What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

    **Answer**: Version control is a file management system that tracks changes to a given file, to allow for access to earlier versions of the file at any time. Version Control is useful for situations when errors have been made to revert to older error-free versions, or to compare different versions.

2. What is a branch and why would you use one?

    **Answer**: A branch is a version of the program code that retains all the files of the original master. However any changes made to the branch will stay on the branch, unless merged with the master. A branch helps programmers work on different aspects of the code, without fear of disrupting the master. It also allows multiple programmers to develop features simultaneously.

3. What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

    **Answer**: A commit is a save point that Git creates, when code needs to be saved during the process of version control. A good commit message should tell the reader exactly what change was affected at that point. It makes reverting to an earlier version easier.

4. What is a merge conflict?

    **Answer**: A merge conflict is an error when the same file and/or same lines of code in the same file are affected in competing ways that are mutually exclusive.
