  Bubble Sort Algorithm
  -Create an array of 5 unsorted integers
  - Sort in ascending order
  1. Create 2 indexes a & b to compare values from 2 cells at a time
  2. Start comparison at a indexed to 0 and b indexed to 1 (next cell)
  3. if value at index b is lower than value at a: swap
  else leave and go to next cell (move index b to the next cell)
  4. Repeat until all cells are done for a = 0
  5. Repeat from a = 0 to a = last position in the array
