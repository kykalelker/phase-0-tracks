    Hello World!
    </h1>
    <p>
    I cannot believe I am in an <strong> intense </strong> program to learn how to program.
    Just 3 months back, it wasn't even on my horizon.. But I'm going to learn a bunch of languages that will help me to achieve at least one of the following:
      <ul>
        <li> set up my startup </li>
        <li> become employable in the startup world </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    In 5 months the languages I will be learning at <a href="https://devbootcamp.com/"> Dev BootCamp </a> are
      <ol>
        <li> HTML </li> 
        <li> CSS </li>
        <li> JavaScript</li>
        <li> SQL </li>
        <li> Ruby </li>
      </ol>
      It's <em> definitely not </em> for the weak-hearted. You've been forewarned!
